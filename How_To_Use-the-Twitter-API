#Sample of using the Twitter API
(This guide was written when Twitter Gem version 5.11.x)

If you don't have your Twitter API keys/tokens, visit:
https://dev.twitter.com/ and follow the process for requesting.

The Twitter Gem:

I've added the dotenv gem to my Gemfile so I can use ENV['xxxxx'] as indicated
below.  Or you can just pass your Twitter credentials.  But I think the dotenv
way is a better solution.  (NOTE: be sure to put .env in your .gitignore file)


Test your access:
1.  Go to your rails console and enter the following:

client = Twitter::REST::Client.new do |config|
  config.consumer_key        = ENV['TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY']
  config.consumer_secret     = ENV['TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET']
  config.access_token        = ENV['TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN']
  config.access_token_secret = ENV['TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET']
end


Example:
1] pry(main)> client = Twitter::REST::Client.new do |config|
[1] pry(main)*   config.consumer_key        = ENV['TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY']
[1] pry(main)*   config.consumer_secret     = ENV['TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET']
[1] pry(main)*   config.access_token        = ENV['TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN']
[1] pry(main)*   config.access_token_secret = ENV['TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET']
[1] pry(main)* end
=> #<Twitter::REST::Client:0x007fee95cb1fc0
 @access_token="*****************",
 @access_token_secret="*****************",
 @consumer_key="*****************",
 @consumer_secret="*****************">
[2] pry(main)>

Note: I 'starred' out my actual settings, but you should be able to confirm that
      your settings are good.  If you see nil for any of the values, then there
      was an issue - perhaps a typo.

Try some queries:
client.friends

client.search("some search term here")
